<h2>Faka Imali Uzobona</h2>
<h3>Welcome Dimamazo's Kitchen website</h3>
<p>The layout. </p>
<p>The layout is the first element which I changed from a normal text to a center aligned text which is more appealing and luring in the customers eye.
</p>
<p>This is a slight layout refashion.</p>
<p>The typography</p>
<p>The Font-Family is also restyled to "font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" this Font is reused in every page of my website</p>
<p>The font-size improved to a larger size.</p>
<p>Position</p>
<p>Proper positioning of the elements play a very crucial role and always have to be on point. I've refashioned the positioning to "relative".</p>
<p>Decoration</p>
<p>The background-color is another elemnet which has changed. My website had a white background-color and I changed it to "background: blueviolet" after many reviews i was informed to make a bit more brighter or rather inviting/exciting. </p>
<p>The Font-color has been remade and colored to "cyan".</p>
<p>The media quiery that triggers when the width screen is less that the Font-Family changes </p>
